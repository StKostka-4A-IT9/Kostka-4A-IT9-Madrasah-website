        </center>

        <h2 class="background-titles-2">Background and Significance of the Study</h2>
        <p class="bg-paragraph">In this study, we aim to find a way to help our partner institution efficiently create compost. According to the NRDC, Composting is the natural process of recycling things like food scraps and leaves into fertilizer. This is a highly beneficial practice to communities and to the environment as it prevents soil erosion as it retains large amounts of water, which would prevent things like flooding in communities. It also helps conserve water due to the fact it is able to retain and transfer large amounts of water, promotes healthy plant growth as it enriches the soil and suppresses a number of plant diseases, and reduces waste since most compost is created with waste like food scraps. This is great news to any community, as it not only helps with rainwater management; it also gives the community an array of benefits like reduced community waste to dispose or manage of, enriched soil fit for vegetation and promoted healthy plant growth. With the power of composting, they would be able to possibly create a food source stable enough that they could rely on instead of spending money on buying groceries. If they could grow enough of these vegetables and plants, they could even explore the idea of selling these in order to create a profit that could be used in order to further improve the community. It also helps combat climate change, as it helps strengthen ecosystems to battle against the rising temperatures and cuts greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere down. Even though composting is very beneficial practice, many people opt to not do it and instead buy artificial fertilizers due the amount of time it takes to compost. That is why studies in possible accelerants to speed up this natural process would be very beneficial, as many more people would opt to practice this and help benefit the environment and their communities. The more people practice composting and using the natural fertilizer they create from it, the more benefits our environment and our society as a whole will experience. We hope that this research would be of great help to our partner institution, Madrasah, as they can source their daily supply of provisions from a stable source of food from a vegetable garden. While researching information on our partner institution, we had found out that they were asking for donations for provisions for daily supplies such as food for the children they teach. This had particularly piqued our interest, as this would mean the institution only has a limited supply of food. We had put ourselves to the task to look for a possible solution to this, and had come up with the solution of the creation of a vegetable or plant garden. This would provide the institution with access to more food, and could possibly save them a lot of money compared to buying groceries frequently. But the process of growing plants is not all that easy, and there are issues like the soil not being fit for vegetation or the plants would not be able to defend themselves from any potential diseases. Composting would be a great fix for this, and would save the institution a lot of money as it would help them grow healthy plants and vegetables without having to buy a pricey fertilizer. Composting can be different from each other so we decided to focus on materials that can be found in every household as compost. We have found that food scraps and dried leaves are very common and can be used as compost, these materials are cheap and can mostly be recycled and the nutrients in the material are enough to be used as fertilizer to help the Bok choy (Brassica rapa) grow which is the plant we will be focusing on. This research can greatly benefit the Madrasah of solving their issue of limited supply of food. With this research and study, we hope to prove its effectiveness and showcase how leaf mix and food scraps compost on plants.</p>
        
        <h2 class="background-titles-2">Statement of the Problem</h2>
        <p class="bg-paragraph">How will Leaf and Food Scrap Mix Compost affect the height and number of leaves on Bok choy?</p>
        
        <h2 class="background-titles-2">Hypothesis</h2>
        <p class="bg-paragraph">If more leaf and food scrap mix compost is used, then the Bok Choy will grow taller and have more leaves than the Bok Choy without leaf and food scrap mix compost.</p>
        
        <h2 class="background-titles-2">Review of Related Literature</h2>
        <p class="bg-paragraph">Compost as quoted by ADM in general is a multitude of decomposed organic material such as leaves, shredded twigs, and kitchen scraps. Compost has been regarded by experts in Syngenta as one of the most basic yet effective ways to recycle organic matter such as leaves and food scraps, into a valuable fertilizer. This is wonderful for plant growth as said by workers of Agworld by adding fertilizer which provides plants with nutrients that will boost the growth of the plant and the health of said plant. Aside from being an effective fertilizer for plants, it is very beneficial to the soil and the environment in general as well. According to the US Composting Council, compost improves the soil’s ability to retain water and nutrients. It does this by increasing the soil's cation exchange capacity, which is another benefit that the compost provides to the soil.
        <br><br>
        Our group will focus on the growth of Bok Choy. From what we have learned from our sources, the nutrients the Bok Choy needs to gain optimal growth are nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. It helps the plant maintain its green color, produces leaves and ensures energy through photosynthesis. The Bok choy metabolizes nitrogen through cell membranes in roots in the form of amino acid or nitrate. Phosphorus helps develop new roots and help fight diseases. Phosphorus is metabolized from soil solutions and moves to the root surface through diffusion. Potassium helps the plant develop strong stems and helps the plant grow faster. Potassium is metabolized through the roots where potassium is in the form of ions which dissolves in water.
        <br><br>
        The type of compost that will be able to deliver the nutrients is leaf and food scrap compost mix. Food scrap mix is rich in nutrients such as potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, and many other nutrients as well. This is because it is composed of many organic things that are rich with these types of nutrients—and an example is egg shells, banana peels, vegetable scraps, and etc. Because food scrap mix can deliver the nutrients needed by the Bok Choy along with multiple other nutrients, it is one of the best types of compost we can use to deliver nutrients to the Bok Choy. We will be adding crushed and dried/dead leaves to the compost pile as it also has nitrogen content and it will greatly help with the composting process. The composting process will take approximately 1 month to complete, and the materials needed for it are food scraps, dried and shredded leaves, and soil. We will be using the layering method, each layer alternating (first soil, then food scraps, then leaves, then soil again, etc.). We will be using a gallon bottle to place our compost in, and we will be mixing the compost once every week to speed up the composting process.
        <br><br>
        Composting food mix improves soil health and lessens possible erosion. This compost contains the three primary nutrients needed by plants which are potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus. By placing compost onto the soil that the crop is planted in, it is able to deliver these nutrients to the plant.
        <br><br>
        Leaf mix does a wonderful job of guarding plants from drought damage to plants, due to its water-holding capacity. It also improves soil tilth, making it easier to cultivate the soil. The cation exchange capacity of soils is increased, cousin the soil to hold an abundance of plant nutrients for longer times. Also, this added organic matter provides a food source for desirable soil microorganisms.
        <br><br>
        The most effective way to use compost to successfully deliver benefits to the plant is direct composting. Direct composting is where you make a trench and fill it up with compost. In this way, the compost will directly touch the soil, and the nutrients from the compost can be quickly delivered to the plant and make the soil healthier. This method can help the environment of the Bok Choy be helpful for its growth.
