    <h1 class="background-titles"> What is The Madrasah?</h1>
    <p class="bg-paragraph">The Madrasah is a institution that offers education to the children in their community. They offer lessons on a number of things, such as the practices and traditions of the Islam. Their mission is to educate the children and give them the chance to learn and pursue their education despite of their circumstances. Most of the children that they teach in their community are from difficult background, which hinders them from properly pursuing their education because of the circumstances they are in.  Some of them even go to work before going to school because they have to help their parents support their family. The Madrasah does their best to help them in their education with the tuition of 250 per family. No matter how many members of the family will attend school, the tuition will stay as 250. This is great--as sending multiple members in the family to school usually costs lots. The Madrasah also offers and provides learning materials to their students. These school's students also mostly range from kindergarten to grade six students.</p>

    <h1 class="background-titles">The Madrasah's Mission</h1>
    <p class="bg-paragraph">It is the mission of Madrasah to prepare the children belonging to the islamic faith to become assiduous and committed muslims. Through the development  of their social, moral, intellectual, and religious education through a traditional madrasah method, the program seeks to empower the muslim youth to pursue beneficial endeavors for themselves, and their families. This program was intended to balance out the lack of educational materials for such a method. The programs that are included in this mission are teaching the Arabic language both in reading and writing, guidance to the social and religious role of an islamic child, and outreach programs. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="background-titles">Their Rich History</h1>
    <p class="bg-paragraph">Arab missionaries and Malay explorers brought Islamic education to the Philippines, and Madrasah education was mostly done in the teacher's home, although sometimes in the masjid or mosque to learn Arabic reading and writing as means to read the Qur'an. It is thought to correspond with the rise and spread of Islam. A missionary and his religious efforts help strengthen the growing Islamic community and spread Islamic teachings. Another Arab missionary rose to prominence, becoming a sultan and overseeing the construction of mosques and the foundation of madaris.
    </p>
