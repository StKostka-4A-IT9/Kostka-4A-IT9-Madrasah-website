            <h1 class="background-titles">Problem Identification</h1>
            <p class="bg-paragraph">This project was made to help the Madrasah. After researching on our partner institution, we learned that the Madrasah has been facing many problems, particularly the problems of a lack of funds and educators. The lack of educators can impact the institution negatively in many ways, especially in the quality of the education they give to the students in the Madrasah. Because they are understaffed in this aspect, the teachers will have to carry the burden of doing the work preparing lessons and taking care of many students. They might get overworked and feel demotivated to teach properly, hindering the quality of the lessons they provide to the students. And because of the lack of funds, they encounter difficulty to provide learning materials and other needed equipment to the students.</p>

      <h1 class="background-titles">Proposed Intervention of the Project Proposal</h1>
      <p class="bg-paragraph"> With this project, we can help ease the problems of the Madrasah in our own way. We are able to help them in teaching the children and providing some of the necessities they need to teach them. This institution is doing a wonderful thing by helping the children in their community, and our project is something we made in hope to help them carry out their advocacy as much as we possibly can.</p> 

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column left">
            <h1 class="background-titles">Background on Our Project</h1>
            <p class="bg-paragraph"> The main focus of this project is to help the Madrasah with their mission of educating the children in their community. During our implementation, we will be volunteering to help the Madrasah teach the children every week. This is so that we can lighten the load and help them with their problem. We will also be selling munchkins to people in our school and using the profit from it to buy school materials for the children of Madrasah. Any funds we have that we are not able to liquidate will be given to the Madrasah.</p>
            <p class="bg-paragraph"> This project also helps promote the education of the children of Madrasah. The project aims to sell at least 500 pieces of munchkins. With the money we make from selling the munchkins,  we will be buying school materials for the students in the Madrasah. Because they have these learning materials, their learning experience will be much better. Our budget for this project is 784 PHP, which will be used to purchase the materials and ingredients needed in selling and making the munchkins. </p>

    <h1 class="background-titles">Significance of Our Project</h1>
    <p class="bg-paragraph">The project is very important to the institution, the Ateneo students (particularly our group members), and the public in general. 
    
    <p class="bg-paragraph"> This project is important to the institution because it helps them with their problems by lightening the burden of these issues. The Madrasah does not have to worry as much in trying to find teachers as we are able to help them teach their students through our weekly tutoring services. We are also able to help them provide the learning materials the children need, so the Madrasah does not have to worry about sourcing the funds needed to purchase these things. Because the burden of these problems are lightened, the Madrasah can focus on effectively carrying out their mission. They can also focus on other problems that they need to solve in order to grow as an institution. So in other words, our project is important to the institution because it helps them effectively carry out their mission to teach the children in their community. </p>
        
    <p class="bg-paragraph"> The project is important to the Ateneo students because it helps us effectively carry out the schoolâ€™s missions and values, particularly the values of Magis and being Men and Women for others. Through this project, we are able to be men and women for others as we are able to be of service to others, particularly to the people in the Madrasah. We are able to help the children in their education and the teachers in their job with teaching these students. We are also able to exercise the value of Magis, as we do our best to go above and beyond to provide for these students by selling munchkins to help buy learning materials for them. So, this project is important to our group, who are Ateneo students, because we are able to be the Atenean that the school is shaping us to be. </p>
        
    <p class="bg-paragraph"> And lastly, this project is important to the public in general because it helps an institution that contributes a lot to society. The Madrasah is an institution that contributes a lot to society by providing children the education they need. Education is a basic right, and everyone should have the chance to learn lessons that are beneficial to their growth as a person. Schools train people to become well-functioning members of society, and it is a saddening reality that some people are not able to pursue their education and attend school because of their circumstances. The Madrasah does their part in helping these people to pursue their education, giving this all to them for free. It is a wonderful thing they do, but problems may arise and hinder them from being able to fully act out their mission. Our project does our best to help the Madrasah with these problems, particularly the problem of the lack of funds and educators. This is the main objective of our project. </p>
        
    <p class="bg-paragraph">Because of all of this, we can therefore believe wholeheartedly that our project is significant to the institution, the Ateneo students, and the public in general. </p>

    <h1 class="background-titles">Project Rationale</h1>
    <p class="bg-paragraph">This project is very important because it helps increase the number of educators readily available to teach the students in the Madrasah. As we have found out, the Madrasah is suffering from a shortage of teachers and educators. This is a serious problem, because that would mean that they might not be able to teach all the students properly or effectively. With our project, we are able to help out by volunteering to teach the students as much as we can so that the Madrasah does not have to worry about struggling to find people who are able to teach their students. They will not have to spend anything as well as we will be handling expenses of our tutoring services with the money we create from selling munchkins. So, our project is important because it helps ease the Madrasah with one of the problems they are coping with, and also ensures that no new issues or problems will pop up for them while we are implementing this project.</p>

    <h1 class="background-titles">Project Objectives</h1>
    <p class="bg-paragraph">We aim to help the Madrasah with their issue of a lack of educators by volunteering to teach the Madrasah students.<br>
        The specific objectives of this project are:<br>
        1. Compute all expenses made when making munchkins, and pricing each fairly.<br>
        2. Create munchkins and sell 100 or more pieces. <br>
        3. Reach target amount of earnings to use for buying and preparing learning materials.<br>
        4. Buy, acquire, and prepare all needed materials for the tutoring services. <br>
        5. Tutor the children in the Madrasah.<br>
        </p>

    <h1 class="background-titles">Project Outcomes</h1>
    <p class="bg-paragraph">The primary outcome is to help the Madrasah by volunteers who will help them teach the children.<br>
        1. Enough munchkins should be sold to be able to buy school materials for the children in Madrasah.<br>
        2.Worksheets and lesson materials should be properly prepared for tutoring.<br>
        3.The project success will be measured with the following indicators: amount of munchkins sold, amount of school material that can be bought, and the amount of students who have found our services helpful.<br>
